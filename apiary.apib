Together with Spanish flag-carrier Iberia, British Airways makes up the International Airlines Group (IAG), in which it is the senior partner.",
    "History": "Able to trace its origins back to the birth of civil aviation and the creation, on 5 October 1916, of Aircraft Transport and Travel (AT&T). The company launched the world's first sustained daily international scheduled air service on 25 August 1919, flown between London and Paris. Several fledgling airlines evolved in the UK over the next few years, and on 31 March 1924, four of them: British Air Marine Navigation Company, Daimler Airways (previously Daimler Hire, a successor to AT&T), Handley Page Transport and The Instone  Air Line, merged to become Imperial Airways Limited. Within a year, Imperial Airways was providing services from the new London Airport at Croydon to Paris, Brussels, Basle, Cologne and Zurich. New services were introduced during the 1920s and 1930s to Egypt, the Arabian Gulf, India, South Africa, Singapore and West Africa. A service between the UK and Australia was established in 1935, in co-operation with Qantas Empire Airways, which operated the sectors between Singapore and Australia.<p>  In 1935, a number of smaller, privately-owned, air transport companies which had developed and launched services of their own merged to form BA Limited. Following a government review, Imperial Airways and BA Limited were nationalised on 24 November 1939, to form British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). In the pre- and early post-war period, BOAC continued to operate long-haul services, primarily by flying boat around the globe. The Civil Aviation Act of 1946 led to the division of BOAC into three separate companies. While BOAC continued to operate Empire, Far East and North American routes, British European Airways (BEA) was established on 1 August 1946 to operate domestic and European routes, and British South America Airways (BSAA) was created to operate routes to South America and the Caribbean. Just three year later, BSAA was re-integrated into BOAC. BOAC operated the world's first passenger jet service, between London and Johannesburg, with a de Havilland Comet 1, on 2 May 1952. <p>  In 1967, the government set up another study into the industry, which recommended the creation of a National Air Holding Board, to be responsible for the UK’s two major airlines, BOAC and BEA, and two smaller regional carriers, Northeast Airlines and Cambrian Airways which became part of the British Air Services group The Board was also responsible for the creation of an independently-owned 'second force' airline, to be brought about by ‘unifying various independents`. The companies concerned were Caledonian Airways and the airline it took over, in November 1970, British United Airways, to create the independent carrier that in September 1971 became British Caledonian Airways (BCAL). The new independent had an extensive global route network serving over 40 destinations in around 25 countries on five continents. In August 1971, the enactment of  Civil Aviation Act resulted in BEA and BOAC coming together as British Airways (BA) on 1 April 1974. Although this merger was to lead initially to substantial financial losses and industrial strife, the new airline inherited its predecessors' pioneering paths, launching the world's first supersonic passenger service, from London to Bahrain (simultaneously with Air France’s service from Paris to Rio) with Concorde on 21 January 1976. <p>  In July 1979 the Government announced its intention to sell shares in BA. In February 1987 BA was privatised. A merger with British Caledonian was announced in July 1987, and completed with integration of the two carriers under the BA brand on 14 April 1988. <p>  In 1992, BA acquired an initial 49.9% holding in France's leading independent carrier, TAT European Airlines, which was increased to 100% in 1996. BA later withdraw completely from French domestic operations. BA also acquired 49% of Friedrichshafen-based regional carrier Delta Air Regionalflug in early 1992, renaming the carrier as Deutsche BA in March 1992. <p>  In 1993, BA acquired a 25% stake in  Australian flag-carrier Qantas for £290 million. In January 1993, BA had also formed an alliance with US Airways, purchasing a 24.6% stake in the Charlotte-based carrier for $300 million. Following a court battle, there was a parting of the ways with the US carrier in 1996, after BA announced its intention of forming a partnership with American Airlines. BA subsequently divested its interests in US Airways and the codeshare between the two carrier expired in March 1997. <p>   At the end of 1998, BA agreed to acquire CityFlyer Express, which was operating as a BA franchise, for £75 million. <p>   BA was a founder member of the Oneworld global airline alliance, with American Airlines, Canadian, Cathay Pacific and Qantas on 1 February 1999. <p>   BA acquired a 9% stake in Iberia Lineas Aereas de España SA in March 2000, as part of the Spanish airline's privatisation programme. BA was engaged in merger talks with KLM from June 2000, but withdrew in September 2000, after failing to reach agreement with the Dutch carrier. In November 2000, BA announced much-improved second quarter financial results and put its low cost carrier subsidiary, Go Fly Aviation, up for sale. In December 2000, BA restructured its loss-making Gatwick operation, reducing long-haul flights and cutting around 1000 jobs. <p>   In 2002, plans for a potential merger with American Airlines, already raised and abandoned more than once during the 1990s, again came to nothing. <p>   In 2001, in the aftermath of \"9/11\" BA cut flight operations by 10%, withdrew 20 aircraft from service and cut 7,000 jobs, in line with reduced passenger demand. <p>   On 8 September 2004, BA announced the sale of its 18.5% stake in Qantas, which raised £425 million. In October 2005 BA again resumed merger talks with American Airlines. <p>   On 5 March 2007, BA completed the sale of its UK regional subsidiary carrier, BA Connect, to Flybe. Through the deal, which included many of the aircraft and routes of BA Connect, but not the brand itself, BA also acquired a 15% stake in Flybe. The BA Connect brand was subsequently adopted by franchise partner GB Airways on all of its services for BA, flown from Manchester, East Midlands and Bristol from 25 March 2007. <p>   A new wholly-owned subsidiary, BA Cityflyer, launched services from London City Airport on 25 March 2007.<p>   From late April 2007, BA was considering making a consortium offer with a number of private equity companies for Spanish flag carrier Iberia. In early June 2007, it was announced that BA and its consortium partners had agreed that BA would hold the right to take over Iberia within three to five years, as part of any possible bid by the consortium for the Spanish airline. <p>   In June 2007, CEO Willie Walsh indicated that BA would be operating transatlantic business class services to US destinations, using dedicated aircraft by the summer of 2008. This plan came to fruition in July 2008 when wholly-owned subsidiary \"OpenSkies\" launched services from New York (JFK) to Paris Orly with a Boeing 757 configured for just 82 passengers in business, premium economy and economy classes. <p>  In October 2008, British Airways announced that it would be ending its franchise agreements with both GB Airways and Loganair, so as to concentrate on its transatlantic services. On 2 July 2008, BA agreed to acquire French premium carrier L'Avion for £54 million (US$ 108 million), in a deal which was completed by the end of July 2008. L'Avion was to be merged into OpenSkies, which would then operate three Boeing 757s. <p>   On 29 July 2008, BA and Iberia announced they were negotiating for a potential all-share merger between the two carriers. Talks held with Qantas in December 2008 over a possible merger were abandoned after Qantas had insisted on being the majority shareholder in the merged carrier. <p>  On 23 October 2009, BA launched a new all-business service, operating the first long-haul flights between London City Airport and New York's JFK International Airport, using two Airbus A318s configured for 32 business class only seats. The A318s were equipped for the steep approaches required at London City Airport. Westbound services required a fuel stop at Shannon, which also allowed passengers to pre-clear US Customs. <p>  In November 2009, and after months of talks, British Airways and Iberia agreed to merge. The merger was initially expected to be completed in late 2010. <p>   On 13 February 2010, the US DoT issued its initial approval of the codeshare and joint venture anti-trust Immunity application made with Oneworld partners BA, American Airlines, Finnair and Royal Jordanian. Anti-Trust Immunity was duly received and BA, Iberia and American Airlines signed a joint business agreement covering their North Atlantic routes. On 8 April 2010, BA and Iberia signed their formal merger agreement. <p>   In July 2010, Oneworld Alliance members BA, American Airlines, Finnair, Iberia and Royal Jordanian Airlines were cleared to co-operate on transatlantic routes from 6 October 2010, after receiving final anti-trust immunity approval from the EU and US DoT. <p>  In September 2010, to Iberia decided to proceed with the BA merger. On 29 November 2010, the shareholders of both BA and Iberia voted in favour of the merger. On 24 January 2011, British Airways' and Iberia's shares were cancelled and the merged companies began trading as the International Consolidated Airlines Group, signifying the completion of the merger. In April 2011, British Airways and Iberia announced that their respective cargo operations were to be combined into a single business division, although both retained their existing brands.<p>   Parent the International Airlines Group announced an agreement in principle to buy British Midland International bmi from the Lufthansa Group on 4 November 2011. <p>  Parent IAG announced the acquisition of BMI British Midland from Lufthansa for £172.5 million ($271 million) on 22 December 2011.",

BA subsequently divested its interests in US Airways and the codeshare between the two carrier expired in March 1997. <p>   At the end of 1998, BA agreed to acquire CityFlyer Express, which was operating as a BA franchise, for £75 million. <p>   BA was a founder member of the Oneworld global airline alliance, with American Airlines, Canadian, Cathay Pacific and Qantas on 1 February 1999. <p>   BA acquired a 9% stake in Iberia Lineas Aereas de España SA in March 2000, as part of the Spanish airline's privatisation programme. BA was engaged in merger talks with KLM from June 2000, but withdrew in September 2000, after failing to reach agreement with the Dutch carrier. In November 2000, BA announced much-improved second quarter financial results and put its low cost carrier subsidiary, Go Fly Aviation, up for sale. In December 2000, BA restructured its loss-making Gatwick operation, reducing long-haul flights and cutting around 1000 jobs. <p>   In 2002, plans for a potential merger with American Airlines, already raised and abandoned more than once during the 1990s, again came to nothing. <p>   In 2001, in the aftermath of \"9/11\" BA cut flight operations by 10%, withdrew 20 aircraft from service and cut 7,000 jobs, in line with reduced passenger demand. <p>   On 8 September 2004, BA announced the sale of its 18.5% stake in Qantas, which raised £425 million. In October 2005 BA again resumed merger talks with American Airlines. <p>   On 5 March 2007, BA completed the sale of its UK regional subsidiary carrier, BA Connect, to Flybe. Through the deal, which included many of the aircraft and routes of BA Connect, but not the brand itself, BA also acquired a 15% stake in Flybe. The BA Connect brand was subsequently adopted by franchise partner GB Airways on all of its services for BA, flown from Manchester, East Midlands and Bristol from 25 March 2007. <p>   A new wholly-owned subsidiary, BA Cityflyer, launched services from London City Airport on 25 March 2007.<p>   From late April 2007, BA was considering making a consortium offer with a number of private equity companies for Spanish flag carrier Iberia. In early June 2007, it was announced that BA and its consortium partners had agreed that BA would hold the right to take over Iberia within three to five years, as part of any possible bid by the consortium for the Spanish airline. <p>   In June 2007, CEO Willie Walsh indicated that BA would be operating transatlantic business class services to US destinations, using dedicated aircraft by the summer of 2008. This plan came to fruition in July 2008 when wholly-owned subsidiary \"OpenSkies\" launched services from New York (JFK) to Paris Orly with a Boeing 757 configured for just 82 passengers in business, premium economy and economy classes. <p>  In October 2008, British Airways announced that it would be ending its franchise agreements with both GB Airways and Loganair, so as to concentrate on its transatlantic services. On 2 July 2008, BA agreed to acquire French premium carrier L'Avion for £54 million (US$ 108 million), in a deal which was completed by the end of July 2008. L'Avion was to be merged into OpenSkies, which would then operate three Boeing 757s. <p>   On 29 July 2008, BA and Iberia announced they were negotiating for a potential all-share merger between the two carriers. Talks held with Qantas in December 2008 over a possible merger were abandoned after Qantas had insisted on being the majority shareholder in the merged carrier. <p>  On 23 October 2009, BA launched a new all-business service, operating the first long-haul flights between London City Airport and New York's JFK International Airport, using two Airbus A318s configured for 32 business class only seats. The A318s were equipped for the steep approaches required at London City Airport. Westbound services required a fuel stop at Shannon, which also allowed passengers to pre-clear US Customs. <p>  In November 2009, and after months of talks, British Airways and Iberia agreed to merge. The merger was initially expected to be completed in late 2010. <p>   On 13 February 2010, the US DoT issued its initial approval of the codeshare and joint venture anti-trust Immunity application made with Oneworld partners BA, American Airlines, Finnair and Royal Jordanian. Anti-Trust Immunity was duly received and BA, Iberia and American Airlines signed a joint business agreement covering their North Atlantic routes. On 8 April 2010, BA and Iberia signed their formal merger agreement. <p>   In July 2010, Oneworld Alliance members BA, American Airlines, Finnair, Iberia and Royal Jordanian Airlines were cleared to co-operate on transatlantic routes from 6 October 2010, after receiving final anti-trust immunity approval from the EU and US DoT. <p>  In September 2010, to Iberia decided to proceed with the BA merger. On 29 November 2010, the shareholders of both BA and Iberia voted in favour of the merger. On 24 January 2011, British Airways' and Iberia's shares were cancelled and the merged companies began trading as the International Consolidated Airlines Group, signifying the completion of the merger. In April 2011, British Airways and Iberia announced that their respective cargo operations were to be combined into a single business division, although both retained their existing brands.<p>   Parent the International Airlines Group announced an agreement in principle to buy British Midland International bmi from the Lufthansa Group on 4 November 2011. <p>  Parent IAG announced the acquisition of BMI British Midland from Lufthansa for £172.5 million ($271 million) on 22 December 2011.",

This compares with 2011's tally of 157 firm orders and 79 options.</p><p>Bagnato says ATR has sold around 700 aircraft over the past seven years in the 50- to 90-seat market. "In terms of new sales, ATR accounts for 39% of total sales between 2005 and 2012," he says.</p><p>ATR puts Bombardier's Q300 and Q400 turboprops at 21% of the market, while the CRJ family and Embraer 170/175 models take 21% and 19% respectively.</p><p>At the end of 2012 ATR had 61% of the total backlog in the 50 to 90-seat aircraft sector. The Q400 accounted for 11%, the CRJ family 17% and the E-170/E-175 11%.</p>"}
